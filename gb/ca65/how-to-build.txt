how to build pong-gb's ca65 version:

"I have gnu make!"

sweet, just go to the cmd and type:

"make" to build.
"make clean" to clean up the build files.


"I don't have make!"

bummer. just type these into the cmd:

ca65 -o pong.o pong.z80
ld65 -C gb.cfg -o pong.gb pong.o
rgbfix -v -t "PONG NICKLAUSW" pong.gb

yes, you can make gameboy games in ca65.
thanks to blargg for that! (one could argue
that ca65 can really be targeted at anything
if you write a macro pack for it).

note that you'll still need to use bentley's
version of rgbds for rgbfix (note: dependency on bison).
linux users can just use a simple 'make'.
to build it on windows, use cygwin with
bison installed, of course.
