how to build pong-gb's rgbds version:

"I have gnu make!"

sweet, just go to the cmd and type:

"make" to build.
"make clean" to clean up the build files.


"I don't have make!"

bummer. just type these into the cmd:

rgbasm -o pong.o pong.z80
rgblink -t -o pong.gb pong.o
rgbfix -v -t "PONG NICKLAUSW" pong.gb

note that you'll need to use bentley's
version of rgbds (note: dependency on bison).
linux users can just use a simple 'make'.
to build it on windows, use cygwin with
bison installed, of course.


when compiling rgbds through cygwin:
if cygwin complains about string functions
not existing, go in the makefile and add
"-D_GNU_SOURCE" to REALCFLAGS.
