how to build pong-gb's rgbds version:

"I have coffee!"

sweet, just go to the cmd and type:

"cake assemble" to assemble.
"cake link" to link.
"cake build" to assemble and link.
"cake clean" to get rid of the build files.


"I don't have coffee!"

bummer. just type these into the cmd:

rgbasm -o pong.o pong.z80
rgblink -t -o pong.gb pong.o
rgbfix -v -t "PONG NICKLAUSW" pong.gb

note that you'll need to use bentley's
version of rgbds (note: dependency on bison).
linux users can just use a simple 'make'.
to build it on windows, use cygwin with
bison installed, of course.


when compiling rgbds through cygwin:
if cygwin complains about string functions
not existing, go in the makefile and add
"-D_GNU_SOURCE" to REALCFLAGS.
