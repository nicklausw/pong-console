how to build pong-sms:


"I have coffee!"

sweet, just go to the cmd and type:

"cake assemble" to assemble.
"cake link" to link.
"cake build" to assemble and link.
"cake clean" to get rid of the build files.


"I don't have coffee!"

bummer. go to the cmd, do:

wla-z80 -o pong.asm pong.o

create a file called linkfile with these contents:

[objects]
pong.o

then execute:
wlalink -vd linkfile pong.sms
